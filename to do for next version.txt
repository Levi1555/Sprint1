need to add:
1. the first mine should not be a mine
2. in the render- combine al cases by adding to the class var
3. Clicking the Safe-Click button will mark a random covered cell (for a few seconds) that is safe to click (does not contain a MINE).
4. Create a “manually create” mode in which user first positions the mines (by clicking cells) and then plays.
5. 7 boom
